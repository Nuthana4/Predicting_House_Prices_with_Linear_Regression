PROJECT : 🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
✅ Level 2- Task 1

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices based on various features. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python and Scikit-Learn.

📂 Dataset Used

Housing.csv: Contains numerical and categorical features related to residential properties and their selling prices.

🚀 Key Concepts & Workflow

1. Data Collection

Obtained a dataset with relevant numerical and categorical features for housing prices.

2. Data Exploration and Cleaning

Handled missing values
Converted categorical data using one-hot encoding
Explored dataset structure and statistics

3. Feature Selection

Selected features that influence house prices
Dropped unnecessary columns

4. Model Training

Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn
Trained on 80% of the data

5. Model Evaluation

Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score
Visualization

Plotted Actual vs Predicted house prices to visually assess model performance

🧠 Libraries Used

pandas,
numpy,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
scikit-learn.

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Mean Squared Error (MSE),
R-squared (R²) Score.

📌 Results

The model successfully predicted housing prices with reasonable accuracy using linear regression. The performance was evaluated with standard regression metrics and illustrated visually.
